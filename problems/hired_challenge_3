Challenge 3: Hill
Given an array of integer elements
Your task is to write a function that finds the minimum value X that makes possible the following: generate a new array that is sorted in strictly ascending order by increasing or decreasing each of the elements of the initial array with integer values in the [0, X] range.

Example: Having the initial array [5, 4, 3, 2, 8] the minimum value for X is 3. Decrease the first element (5) by 3, decrease the second one (4) by 1, increase the third one (3) by 1, increase the forth one (2) by 3 and do nothing to the last one (8). In the end we obtain the array [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] which is sorted in strictly ascending order.
print the result X to the standard output (stdout)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
v
which is the array of integers

Data constraints numbers are in ascending order when arranged from the smallest to the largest number
strictly ascending order means that each element is greater than the preceding one (e.g. [1, 2, 2, 3] is NOT strictly ascending order) the length of the array will not exceed 5000
the elements of any of the arrays are integer numbers in the [1, 231 -1] range
Efficiency constraints your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds

Example
Input   Output
v: 5, 4, 3, 2, 8
3

5, 1, 1, 1
4
1, 2, 3, 4

5, 1 => 3 => 2, 3

# just keep a separate array of what it actually is.
